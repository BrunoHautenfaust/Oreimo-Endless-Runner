# My Little Sister Can't Run This Fast
## 俺の妹がこんなに速く走るわけがない

You're probably wondering - _what the hell, man!?_ Read on!

#### About the game:
 - This is a fan game(and my first one, by that) called "_My Little Sister Can't Run This Fast_". An endless runner written in JavaScript and Phaser.
 It's based on the anime [**"Ore no Imōto ga Konna ni Kawaii Wake ga Nai"**](http://myanimelist.net/anime/8769/Ore_no_Imouto_ga_Konnani_Kawaii_Wake_ga_Nai)(_"My Little Sister Can't Be This Cute"_) or _"Oreimo"_ for short. 
 
 
 - You play as Kirino Kousaka - an avid otaku(pretty much an obsessed anime and manga fan). The goal is simple - collect as many items as you can.
